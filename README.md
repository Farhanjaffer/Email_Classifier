# Spam Detection Model

## Overview
This repository presents a spam detection model built using machine learning techniques. The model is designed to classify emails or text messages as either spam or not spam (ham). It follows an end-to-end process starting from collecting labeled data to training a classification algorithm and evaluating its performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Key Components

### Data Collection
The model utilizes labeled data consisting of examples of both spam and non-spam messages. The dataset is collected from various sources and preprocessed to ensure consistency and accuracy.

### Data Preprocessing
Text preprocessing techniques are applied to clean and standardize the text data. This includes removing punctuation, stop words, and performing tokenization and stemming/lemmatization to extract the root form of words.

### Feature Extraction
The preprocessed text data is transformed into numerical features that can be used by machine learning algorithms. Common techniques include Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), and word embeddings.

### Model Training
The extracted features are used to train a classification algorithm, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), or other suitable models. The model learns to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages based on the provided training data.

### Evaluation Metrics
The trained model is evaluated using various metrics to assess its performance. These metrics include:
- **Accuracy:** The overall correctness of the model's predictions.
- **Precision:** The proportion of correctly predicted spam messages among all messages predicted as spam.
- **Recall:** The proportion of correctly predicted spam messages among all actual spam messages.
- **F1-score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of a classifier's performance.
